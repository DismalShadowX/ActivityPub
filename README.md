# ActivityPub ðŸš§

A multitenant ActivityPub server for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), built with [Fedify](https://fedify.dev/). This service makes it possible for independent websites to publish their content directly to the Fediverse, enabling networked publishing to the open social web.

This repository is being actively developed and is currently in early alpha - expect many breaking changes. It is not suitable for production use.

    - Use `tailscale funnel 80` or `ngrok http 80` to expose your local port 80.
3. **Configure Ghost**
    - Run `ghost config url` and set it to tthe URL provided by Tailscale
4. **Start the ActivityPub Service**
    - Run `yarn dev` in the root directory of this project
5. **Open Ghost Admin**
